# NodPT

Visual AI-assisted workflow editor built with Vue 3, Rete.js, and Bootstrap 5.

## 🌟 Our Vision

### The Problem We're Solving
AI tools today are scattered, siloed, and limited. You're forced to jump between different platforms, copy-paste results, and manually coordinate tasks that should flow naturally together. We believe AI should work the way humans do—as a collaborative team where each member brings unique expertise and they all communicate seamlessly.

### Our Mission
NodPT is building the future of AI collaboration—a visual, node-based platform where AI agents work together as an intelligent team. We're creating an open-source ecosystem that democratizes access to multi-agent AI workflows, making it easy for anyone to orchestrate complex tasks through simple visual connections.

## 🤝 Join the Movement

We're an open-source project driven by the belief that powerful AI tools should be accessible to everyone. Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or domain expert—your contribution matters.
